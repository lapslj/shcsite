        I’m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lapslj90">John</a>. I started Summerhall because outsourced finance support
        is often the best way for small- to mid-sized charities to do the most good. Summerhall aims to be the nonprofit finance support 
        <b>that just works</b>.
        </p><p>
        If you’re interested in our services, or even if you just want to chat - please reach out! Some of the most interesting and inspiring
         folks work at nonprofits, and I love meeting them. Email us at <a href="mailto:hello@summerhallconsulting.com">hello@summerhallconsulting.com</a>.

        <button type="button" class="collapsible"> Why we're here</button>
        <div class="coll-cont">
            <p>Outsourced finance is often the best model for small- to mid-size nonprofits: <b>fewer dollars on overhead means more capacity
                for your mission.</b> But over 10+ years in nonprofit finance, I was mystified to see charities run in the the same
                problems again and again:
                 <ul>
                    <li>lack of knowledge transfer, between consultants or from consultants to staff
                    <li>opacity on processes, hours, and billing
                    <li>"one-size-fits-all" when you need specialized attention; unexpected add-ons when you need scale & savings
                    </ul>
                These factors can lead to costly over-dependence on consultants and errors that threaten your tax-exempt status.
                <b>Outsourced support should free you up to focus on your programs</b>, not force you to constantly retrain your consultants and check their work.</p>
        </div>        
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">How we're different</button>
        <div class="coll-cont">
            <p>
                We pride ourselves on <b>transparency, resource-consciousness, and a teaching-based approach.</b> We take time to learn
                your business's unique situation; we develop clear workplans and solutions that match your needs with your resources; 
                and we document our work & processes extensively so that whoever comes after us isn't grasping in the dark.
                Whatever your role, and whatever the length of our time with you, <b>we want to leave you more capable and confident
                 in your finances</b>, not dependent on billable hours for every single question.

            <h3>Outsourced accounting & CFO functions</h3>
            Experience across a wide breadth of sectors helps us <b> get 
            up to speed more quickly</b> than typical temp staffing. Our
            focus on documentation, streamlining, and error-proofing 
            means whoever comes after us, <b>we'll set them up for success</b>.
        </div>
        <div class="textbox">
            <h3>Financial system migration support</h3>
            We've supported transitions from selection to go-live on all major accounting platforms:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Pre-selection:</b> personalized advice & unique considerations</li>
                <li><b>Mid-transition:</b> fast & reliable data transfer, process transition & documentation, staff training</li>
                <li><b>Post-go-live:</b> system optimization & custom reports</li>

        <div class="textbox">
            <h3>Accounting process optimization</h3>
            Whatever your resources, we'll help you make the most of them:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Customized dashboard design</b> to empower your team to build fast & accurate reports</li>
                <li><b>Budget construction & vs-actual tracking:</b> help teams quickly understand & manage against their budgets</li>

            <h3>Excel, spreadsheet, and database training</h3>
            Might sound basic, but we think spreadsheet fluency is <b>the number-one way</b> for finance professionals to build self-sufficiency, automate their error-checking and learn to create custom solutions
            <ul>
                <li><b>One-off trainings</b> tailored to your specific needs</li>

            <h3>Grant management infrastructure</h3>
            Just because every funder is different doesn't mean you need to start from scratch on every grant. We'll help you spend less time on grant maintenance and more time on grant outcomes by designing systems that anticipate & accommodate them all.
            <ul>
                <li><b>Budget construction models</b> that can support a range of funder formats & detail requests</li>
                <li><b>System guidance</b> to help your teams track and manage grant spend with minimal effort</li>

            <h3>Audit, 990, and Form PC readiness</h3>
            Year-end always comes sooner - and lasts longer - than you expect. We can help assemble and 
            cross-reference your audit PBCs to reduce the additional workload on your existing teams - 
            plus, we can give you a <b>head-start on next year's audit</b> by adjusting your day-to-day processes to anticipate the PBCs.
