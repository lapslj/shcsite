            <h3>Outsourced accounting & CFO functions</h3>
            You didn't join a nonprofit to spend all your time in QuickBooks. 
            Streamline, modernize, and error-proof your finance function so that 
            you can focus on what you’re passionate about. 
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Financial system migration support</h3>
            We've supported transitions from selection to go-live on all below systems & can provide:
            <ul>
                <li>Pre-selection: personalized advisory support, unique factors to consider</li>
                <li>Mid-transition: fast & reliable data transfer, translating processes from previous system, staff training & process documentation</li>
                <li>Post-go-live: system optimization & custom report building</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Accounting process optimization</h3>
            Whatever your resources, we'll help you make the most of them.
            <ul>
                <li>Customized & automated report/dashboard design, with checklists & redundancy checks to empower your team to build fast & accurate reports</li>
                <li>Budget construction & vs-actual tracking: build infrastructure to help teams quickly understand & manage against their budgets</li>

            <h3>Excel, spreadsheet, and database training</h3>
            Might sound basic, but we think spreadsheet fluency is the number-one way for finance professionals to build self-sufficiency, automate their error-checking and learn to efficiently build custom solutions & tools.
            <ul>
                <li>One-off trainings tailored to your specific needs (sending the same emails over and over? constantly consolidating CSVs from multiple systems?)</li>
                <li>Access our library of Excel resources</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Grant management infrastructure</h3>
            Every funder is different, but that doesn't mean you need to start from scratch on every grant. We’ll help you spend less time on grant maintenance and more time on grant outcomes by designing systems that anticipate & accommodate them all.
            <ul>
                <li>Budget construction models that can support a range of funder formats & detail requests</li>
                <li>System guidance to help your teams track and manage grant spend with minimal effort</li>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Audit, 990, and Form PC readiness</h3>
            Year-end always comes sooner - and lasts longer - than you expect. We can help assemble and 
            cross-reference your audit PBCs to reduce the additional workload on your existing teams - 
            plus, we can give you a head-start on next year's audit by adjusting your day-to-day processes to anticipate the PBCs.
